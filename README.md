Java based program that will get the total completion time or individual job time.
The program solves finding longest path on a tree of nodes that have prerequirements.

It implements Khan's Algorithm to find a topological order of the jobs
and to find cycles that maybe present.

Once a topological order is created, it will find the longest path
which will be the total time needed to complete all the jobs.
